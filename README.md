- 👋 Hi, I’m @BradyWalters. I currently teach computer science and cybersecurity at a high school in Las Vegas, NV. I have a BS in Computer Science, and a Master's in Secondary Education. I spend a lot of time outside of my teaching duties making fun stuff or learning new things.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development in general, and I've been spending a lot of time recently learning Javascript. Really I'm interested in learning new skills in any capacity, but that's what I've focused on recently.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, both backend (Node, Express) and frontend (React). I'm also trying to learn Typescript, and I dip back into Kotlin every once in a whlie.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web projects or anything that has to do with education! As a teacher I'm always looking for new technology that can help me out, and if you need help making something I would love to chip in.
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is to DM me on Twitter [@bradywalters_](https://twitter.com/bradywalters_). You can also look at my email on my profile and reach me there!
